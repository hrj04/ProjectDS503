# Project: CRAFTING UNSEEN FUTURE PATTERNS WITH GENERATIVE MODEL : ENHANCING TIME-SERIES FORECASTING
This project is part of a Master's class at KAIST.

## Compatibility
python v3.12

## Description
Our objective is to generate plausible synthetic time-series data

try .ipynb files 
modifying the yaml files in the configs, you can conduct various experiments

Due to file size limitations, we have only uploaded the executed versions of two files: exp1_stock_non_st.ipynb and exp1_stock_st.ipynb.
you can easily check the experiments performance by these .ipynb files
